"""The wallet history has to say what each row is, without being read closely.

Chris, 2026-11-10, on his own wallet page: below the top-up buttons "there is a
list of transactions against my wallet. But it has no visual distinction so I
was really confused why I was seeing 'platform allowance for period ending 0'
until I realized what it was".

Two defects, not one:

  * a plan allowance is stored as a topup, so the ledger row was shaped like a
    card payment and looked like one in the list, and
  * the note was written from a period end of 0, which is not a date anyone can
    read. Rows like that are already in deployed ledgers, so the read side has
    to be honest about them too.

What is asserted here is what the screen paints from the host's own ledger:
a grant row is a different shape and a named kind, a card row keeps its own,
and no row resurrects "period ending 0".
