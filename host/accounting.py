"""Plugin-led accounting: reserve, then settle on the plugin's report.

The plugin is the sole authority on counts, price, eligibility and the external
balance. The host never infers a charge from a successful request or from saved
audio, and never turns `unknown` into zero.

Only ONE designated connection sells Fireside credits: a (provider, voice,
model) triple. Every other connection is pass-through - no reserve, no debit.
`unknown`/`pending` a report leaves the reservation standing and visibly
pending; it is never guessed or auto-released. A later reconciliation settles it
without a duplicate debit.
